# Service Canada Labs Clone

This repository contains the source code for a Service Canada Labs clone using Astro.  The idea behind this clone is to demonstrate an alternative to using a headless CMS such as Adobe Experience Manager.  This is achieved through Astro's treatment of markdown as a first class citizen.
